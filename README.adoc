This repository is a collection of Docker images which combine the basics
to run a Jenkins Inbound (formerly known as "JNLP") agents with a Docker image.

This makes it easy to use upstream images as Kubernetes pod templates,
Azure Container Instances, AWS ECS/Fargate, or within other Jenkins agent
systems relying on the "Inbound" protocol.
